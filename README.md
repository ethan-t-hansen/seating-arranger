# Event Seating Arranger

## Description
Having to plan out event seating while keeping in mind each individual's preference in regards to who they would like to sit next to and who they would like to avoid is tedious, especially for students who have numerous tasks to juggle at once. The Event Seating Arranger is a one step solution to randomizing seating arrangements for large-scale events based on preference!

This project was completed using Java. I decided to use Java due to it's class-based and object-oriented nature, which helped me categorize data with ease. Java is also preferable due to it's access to the JUnit library, which helped when writing tests for functions.

## Difficulties I faced

One challenge I faced was deciding what type of data to represent as an object vs. just a simple string. In the end, I decided on representing each person and their preferences as a HashMap with a String key (name) and a Preference object to hold the names of the likes and dislikes of an individual. However, I played around with the different ways I could represent the data a lot before the final decision was made, and this can be seen in the "Person" class.
